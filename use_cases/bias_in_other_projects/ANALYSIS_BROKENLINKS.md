Below we present a bias analysis (radar plot & detailed distributions) for the sets of monitors:

- Networks where differences appear. In the file [./data/broken_links_lists.json](./data/broken_links_lists.json) there are 4 lists of monitors ('responsible', 'true', 'wrong', 'origin').

- Compare them with the entire set of ASes. 

In total the radar plot will have 4+1 lines, and the distribution plots 4+1 sets of bars.
