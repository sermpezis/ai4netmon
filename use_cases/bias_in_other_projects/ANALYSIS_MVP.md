Below we present a bias analysis (radar plot & detailed distributions) for the sets of monitors:

- Selected monitors by MVP for different volumes V. In the file [./data/mvp_lists.json](./data/mvp_lists.json) the volumes are the keys of the dictionary and the lists of the monitors the values of the dictionary. In total, we will analyze 5 sets of monitors.

- Compare them with (i) the entire set of ASes and (ii) the set of RIPE RIS + RouteViews monitors. 

In total the radar plot will have 5+2 lines, and the distribution plots 5+2 sets of bars.
