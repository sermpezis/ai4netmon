Analysis for: 

- [MVP](./ANALYSIS_MVP.md): Recommendations by the MVP system for selecting subset of RIPE RIS / RouteViews peers. We analyze the bias of the resulting subsets of peers when a given threshold of data volume V is considered.


- [Broken links](./ANALYSIS_BROKENLINKS.md): Ongoing work about differences between Gao-Rexford model simulations and obsereved paths. We analyse the characteristics of the networks where the differences between sims and reality happen.


- [Metis](./ANALYSIS_METIS.md): Recommendations by the Metis system for adding extra probes in RIPE Atlas. We analyze the bias of the resulting RIPE Atlas platform if the top N recommendations from METIS are added in the set of existing probes.
